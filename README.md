# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns which you might be using but unaware of the names. This would make your code look better and understandable.These are like BluePrints which developer can use to scale,modify and extend the existing code. 
Note:- Try not to use them when not needed. These are to make problem simpler not to make the solution complex.

All patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. Three main groups of patterns are below:

**Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
